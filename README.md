# Financial Institution Project
Data analysis and visualization of financial loans issued by a financial institution.

A financial institution with branches has decided to review its financial loan business to see how it has performed over the years.
The financial institution has tasked the data analytics to answer the following questions :

  1. What was the loan amount issued per year?
  2. Provide a breakdown of the revolving balance for the different credit grades.
  3. What is the total payment amount based on the customer's verification status?
  4. What is the current loan status of the customer and where are they located?
  5. What was the homeownership status of the customers when they made their last payment?
  6. In which state have we issued the most loans and what is the value of loans?
  7. Which loan term is the most popular?
  8. What was the total loan amount issued on each loan term?
  9. The average size of the loan
  10. The average size of the loan per loan term 
  11. The maximum and minimum loans issued
  12. What are the reasons why people take out loans, and what is the total amount issued for each of those reasons?
  13. What are the income demographics of our customer base?
